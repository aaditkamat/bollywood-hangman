This is a Bollywood spinoff of the [Hollywood Hangman] by @harlessmark. The movie IDs are obtained from the list of [250 Top Rated Indian movies on IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/india/top-rated-indian-movies/?pf_rd_m=A2FGELUUNOQJNL&pf_rd_p=461131e5-5af0-4e50-bee2-223fad1e00ca&pf_rd_r=06N438KJ8C6K9M14VSN3&pf_rd_s=center-1&pf_rd_t=60601&pf_rd_i=india.toprated&ref_=fea_india_ss_toprated_india_tr_india250_sm), with the non-Hindi movies filtered out. The IDs are then used to fetch data from OMDB.
